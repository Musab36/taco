          to Carl's Jr.'s franchisor CKE Restaurants.[2] In 2001, the private investment group Jacobson Partners purchased the chain for $72.5 million US dollars to help aid CKE Restaurants in a debt battle.[3] On August 10, 2005, Palladium Equity Partners
          announced the purchase of Taco Bueno from Jacobson Partners. At the same time, John Miller was appointed CEO of Taco Bueno.[4] In 2011, Ed Lambert became CEO of Taco Bueno, LP. In 2015, Mike Roper became CEO of Taco Bueno, LP. In fall 2015,
